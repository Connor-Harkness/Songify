# Getting Started
Download Songify from our Github [here](https://github.com/songify-rocks/Songify/releases/latest). Make sure to download the file called `Songify.zip` as the other files only contain the source code. Once downloaded extract the zip file and run `Songify.exe`. 
On the first start of the app you will be prompted to link your Spotify account. In order to do so it is advised that you create you own Spotify API Access as explained [here](#linking-spotify). Before you do though, please read the entirety of this document as it contains important information about the app and how to use it.

The patch notes window shows the latest patch notes. On the left side you can select the version you want to see the patch notes for. Clicking on "See all changes on Github" will open the Github page for the selected version.

### About Window
The about window shows some informations about the app and the developers.

### Bot Responses & Commands Window
#### Responses
  - Here you can configure the responses that the bot will send out when certain conditions are met. The responses have parameters such as `{user}` which will be replaced with the username of the user who triggered the response. Not all parameters are available for all responses. The standard configuration uses all the parameters that are available for that specific response.
#### Commands
  - Here you can enable or disable built in chat commands. You can also change the command trigger by clicking on the command name and type in a new one. Spaces in the command name are not allowed.

### Queue Window
The queue window shows the current queue. It displays the artist, title, length and the person who requested the song. You can remove songs from the queue by right clicking on them and selecting "Delete". The Queue inside the app is not coupled with the queue in Spotify. If you delete a song in the queue window it will not be deleted in Spotify.

### Blocklist Window
The blocklist shows two lists. One is for blocked artists the other for blocked user (chatters). You can add artists or users to the blocklist by selecting Artist or User on the dropdown menu and type in the name of the artist or user. If multiple Artist are found you'll see a list with all the results and you can check which one you want to add to the blocklist. You can remove artists or users from the blocklist by right clicking on them and selecting "Delete". 

### History Window
Songify will keep track of your listening history, if enabled. You can enable the history in the history window's title bar. THere is a button named "Save" and it has either a X or checkmark on it depending on if the history is enabled or not. If you click on the button it will enable or disable the history. The history is saved in a file called "history.shr" in the Songify folder. The history is split in days. You can select a day on the left side and see the songs you listened to with timestamp on the right side. You can also remove songs from the history by right clicking on them and selecting "Delete". If you enable "Upload" the history will be uploaded to our servers and can be shared with others. If you click the chain-link icon it will copy the url to your clipboard.

### Console Window
The console window shows the console output of the app. You can use the console to debug issues and see what is going on. The console is attached to the main window by default but can be detached using the button in the top left corner.

On the widget generator you can set up the corner radius, icon position, scroll direction, transparency, scroll speed and whetehr to use the album cover or not.

# Setting up OBS
There are multiple ways you can set up the song display in OBS. You can use the widget or you can use the text source. 
- Widget
  - Add a browser source to your scene.
  - Set the URL to the one from the [widget generator](#setting-up-the-widget).
  - Set the width and height to 312x64.
- Source Files (text and image). These files are usually located in the Songify folder.
  - Add a text source and eneble `Read from file`.
    - Browse for either the `Songify.txt` or `Artist.txt` and `Title.txt` file.
  - Add a new image source
    - Browse for the `cover.png` file.
- Custom HTML / CSS
  - If you are familiar with HTML and CSS you can create your own widget. You can use the web server endpoint to retrieve live data from Songify. The data is presented in JSON and updates on every request made to the API. 
  ```JSON
  {
    "Artists":"",
    "Title":"",
    "albums":[
        {
          "Url":"",
          "Width":640,
          "Height":640
        },
        {
          "Url":"",
          "Width":300,
          "Height":300
        },
        {
          "Url":"",
          "Width":64,
          "Height":64
        }
    ],
    "SongID":"",

    "isPlaying":true,
    "url":"",

# Troubleshooting
### Songify is not working
- Make sure you have the latest version of Songify installed.
- If Songify won't boot at all try deleting the entire folder `%localappdata%/Songify.Rocks`.
### Songify is not showing the song info
- Make sure your Spotify account is linked to Songify. You can check this in the settings window. Or on the bottom left corner of the main window.
### Songify is not showing the song cover
- Make sure you have enabled the option to download the album cover.
### Song requests are not working
- You need Spotify Premium to use song requests. Make sure you have followed the steps to [set up Spotify](#spotify-1), [Twitch](#twitch-1) and steps to [set up song requests](#song-requests).
### Songify uses a lot of CPU when grabbing info from Chrome
- This is due to the fact, that we have to intercept with the Chrome application to grab tab titles. This is the only way to get the song info. If you want to reduce the CPU usage you can try to increase the chrome fetch rate. You can do this in the settings window.
### `INVALID CLIENT: Failed to get client` when trying to link my Spotify account
- `INVALID CLIENT: Failed to get client` means that you have not entered the Client ID and Client Secret correctly. Make sure you have copied them correctly and pasted them into the corresponding fields. In doubt you can try to create a new app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
###  `INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI` when trying to link my Spotify account
- `INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI` means that you have not added the redirect URI to the app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications). Make sure you have added `http://localhost:4002/auth` to the Redirect URIs (Click ADD and SAVE, thats important!).

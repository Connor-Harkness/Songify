# Songify
A simple tool that gets the current track from Spotify and saves it as a text file.

# Installation
Download and unzip the application to any destination.

If you are updating from an older version just replace the Songify.exe file.
### [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Inzaniity/Songify/releases)

# Settings
In the top right corner you'll find a settings tab.
Inside are various different setting such as output directory and custom output string!

# Custom Output
You can customize the output of the song! 

{artist}, {title} and {album} are the paramteres you can use

For example

**{artist} - {title}**

will produce

**Welshly Arms - Legendary**

If you plan on using this to display the song in OBS / XSplit I recommend adding a few (5-15) spaces at the end to ensure a clean look.

The application allows you to set a custom pause text. (For Example: Just blank, or "Pause")

You can also download the album cover to display it in OBS / XSplit.

# What is Songify Slim?

Songify Slim is a slimmed down version of my original software Songify. Songify Slim was brought to life because Spotify decided to shut down the local API which Songify was originally built on. 

# What does it do?

It fetches the currently playing song from Spotify and saves it to a text file. Just like magic. 

# Features?

* Gets the currently playing song and saves it as following: `Artist - Title               ` (Whitespaces are for a better marquee in your streaming software of choice!)
* Automatically start with windows (trust me, it is QoL)
* Minimize to the system tray, feels like it isn't running at all.
* Switch between Dark and Light theme, not that it matters since it's most of the time minimized...
* Oh and colors, yeah a lot of colors actually. 23 if I counted that right.

# Troubleshooting
If you don't see anything happen in the Live Output try switching songs and make sure this option is turned **off**!
